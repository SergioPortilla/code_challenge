## Application

Library for the test - [React js](https://reactjs.org/)

Framework used - [Astro](https://astro.build/)

Recommended to use with Astro)

Pattern of application design - [Folder organization](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/)

Pattern of web architecture - [Dynamic Islands with Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/)

Css application - [Styled and css](https://styled-components.com/) (Not recommended by those architectures due to the
rendering of the components could be affected)

Packages manager - [pnpm instead of yarn or npm](https://pnpm.io/) (faster than other solutions)
